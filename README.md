The raw data of jumping rope `raw_data_H5_all.csv` is cleaned through running `R_cleaning_H5.Rmd`.

The csv files `Clean_data_H5.csv` and  `Jump Rope Research.csv` are used for running `HUDK4050 HW6_Kmeans&PCA.Rmd` and `HUDK4050 HW6.Rmd`.

The visualizations of Kmeans and PCA are uploaded individually in the repo as png files.

The conclusion is in the word doc.
